# Hackathon / Docsathon at TACC-25

## 📌 What is it?
The Hackathon / Docsathon is a **two-hour collaborative sprint** during the **TACC-25 OpenCHAMI Developer Summit**.  
Participants will work in small teams to make meaningful contributions to the project — from writing documentation, improving CI/CD workflows, or submitting code changes.

---

## 🎯 Why are we doing this?
- Accelerate progress on OpenCHAMI priorities (code, docs, CI).  
- Give contributors of all experience levels a chance to make a visible impact.  
- Build community by working side-by-side on real tasks.  

---

## 👥 Who can participate?
Everyone! You don’t have to be a Go expert or a seasoned contributor — there will be tasks for:

- **Developers** (Go, Python, CI/CD)  
- **Documentation writers**  
- **New contributors** looking for small wins  
- **Anyone curious about the project**  

---

## 🗓️ When is it happening?
- **Date:** Thursday, Sept 11, 2025  
- **Time:** 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM  *(team sign-up begins at 9:30 AM)*  
- **Where:** TACC-25 Dev Summit, Austin TX

## 💡 How do I suggest a hackathon idea?
We’re collecting ideas ahead of the summit so teams can hit the ground running.  

You can submit an idea by:
- Opening an issue in the **[OpenCHAMI GitHub backlog repo](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues)**  
- Posting in the **#2025-september-dev-summit Slack channel**  
- Talking to a **TSC member** before the event  

### ✅ Principles for proposing a task
- **Align with strategic goals** – Choose topics that support OpenCHAMI’s roadmap (standardizing workflows, improving release automation, enhancing documentation, prototyping new services).  
- **Define clear deliverables** – State what success looks like (e.g., a working proof-of-concept, a draft document, or a PR ready for review).  
- **Fit team size & skill sets** – Keep tasks suited for 2–4 people, with coding, CI/CD, and docs options.  
- **Provide resources & mentors** – Link to docs, READMEs, or guides; try to have a subject-matter expert available.  
- **Limit the scope** – Break down large initiatives into small milestones. A good task should be demo-able in two hours, with the option to continue afterwards.

## 🚀 What’s next?
We’ll gather the best ideas, scope them into hackathon-ready tasks, and publish a **task menu** before the event so participants can pick a challenge quickly.
